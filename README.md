## Project Overview

This repository contains the materials and code examples used in the mentorship sessions at UNIMAR - Faculdade de Marília. The primary focus is on web development concepts, specifically HTML, as demonstrated by the provided code samples. This repository serves as a learning resource for students.

## Features and Functionality

The current content demonstrates fundamental HTML structures and elements.

*   **HTML Structure:**  Demonstrates the basic structure of an HTML document, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. (See: `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **Head Elements:** Usage of `<meta>` tags for character set and viewport configuration, and the `<title>` tag for setting the page title. (See: `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **Heading Elements:**  Demonstrates the use of `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags for creating different levels of headings. (See: `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **Paragraphs and Text Formatting:** Shows how to use `<p>` tags for paragraphs and `<b>`, `<em>`, and `<del>` tags for bold, emphasized, and deleted text formatting. (See: `Class 01/exercício 01/index.html`, `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **Links and Images:**  Demonstrates how to create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag and embed images using the `<img>` tag, including the use of relative paths. (See: `Class 01/exercício 01/index.html`, `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **External Links:** Implements external links with the `target="_blank"` attribute. (See: `Class 01/exercício 01/index.html`, `Class 01/introdução ao HTML/index.html`)
*   **Image Styling:** Shows how to style images using inline CSS (e.g., `border-radius`). (See: `Class 01/exercício 01/index.html`)
